# Example environment variables for the client (Vite)
# Copy this to a new file named .env and fill with real values for local development.

# Backend base URL used by the frontend to call APIs. Default local dev value:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Optional client-side keys (only if the client needs them). If keys are secrets, keep them on the server.
# VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-paypal-client-id-here
# VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key-here

# Notes:
# - Vite only exposes environment variables prefixed with VITE_ to client-side code.
# - Do NOT commit a real .env with secrets to source control. Keep .env in .gitignore.
# - After creating .env, restart the dev server to apply changes.
